  abstract={Pharmacies should act as gatekeepers of opioid distribution. However, rogue pharmacies divert opioids to non-medical users, worsening the opioid epidemic. We examine the spatial redistribution of opioids dispensed following targeted shutdowns by the Drug Enforcement Administration, employing comprehensive pharmacy-level opioid shipments and hospital diagnoses data in ten U.S. states. The displacement of local opioid shipments after removing a pharmacy unveils the extent of non-medical use: medical users can readily switch to competing local pharmacies, while non-medical users cannot. We develop and estimate a structural model to study medical and non-medical consumers' substitution patterns facing changes in their consideration sets. We find that 8\% of pharmacies sell non-medical use opioids with a probability greater than 90\% and that over half of pharmacy-dispensed opioids are diverted to non-medical use. Aggressive pharmacy crackdowns, however, drive a substantial portion of non-medical users who lose access to the black market, which may lead to the rise of more dangerous narcotics such as heroin and fentanyl. }

 title={Closing the Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Gap: Expanding Nurse Practitioners' Prescriptive Authority},
  author={Gui, Lance},
  year={2024}, 
  pdf={CARA_NP_2024_10.pdf}, 
  abstract={Buprenorphine, like nicotine gum for quitting smoking, provides a safe alternative for managing opioid withdrawals during addiction recovery. Despite its effectiveness, a significant gap persists between those needing treatment and those receiving it. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) of 2016, a landmark federal legislation, introduced a critical provision allowing Nurse Practitioners (NPs) to prescribe buprenorphine. Leveraging pre-existing state-level regulations on NPs' prescription authority and comparing pre- and post-CARA implementation periods, I examine the effect of allowing NPs to prescribe buprenorphine independently. I find a notable increase in NPs prescribing buprenorphine, equivalent to 27\% of all buprenorphine prescribers before CARA. This leads to a 16\% rise in buprenorphine dispensation and an 11\% reduction in opioid-related mortality. However, two unintended consequences emerge: evidence of increased opioid misuse, despite the reduction in mortality, and deviations from standard prescribing practices by new entrants in regions with intense provider competition.}

  abstract={I link the Twitter activity of over 35,000 individuals to their offline phone purchasing decisions to examine the consumer response—across both existing and potential customers—to the Batterygate scandal. This incident refers to Apple’s 2017 decision to slow down iPhone processors without disclosing the reason, which was to preserve battery life. To address concerns about the parallel trends assumption, I use a novel trend-extrapolated Differences-in-Differences technique that assumes pre-existing trends for the treatment and control groups would have continued without intervention. My findings reveal that Batterygate negatively affected potential consumers but had no impact on the current user base. This suggests that consumer heterogeneity is a crucial factor in determining how customers respond to even uniformly negative media coverage.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
